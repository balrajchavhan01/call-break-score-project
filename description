Call Break Score Manager (C Project)
This is a C program designed to manage score calculation for the Call Break card game.

How it works:
The program supports 4 players.

The user inputs the number of rounds and the names of all four players.

For each round:

Each player enters their call (bid).

Each player enters the number of tricks they actually made.

The program calculates and stores the score based on the defined rules.

Scoring rules:
If tricks made is equal to the call, the score is call × 10.

If tricks made is less than the call, the score is -call × 10.

If tricks made is greater than the call but less than double the call, the score is call × 10 + extra tricks.

If tricks made is greater than or equal to double the call, the score is -call × 10.

At the end of all rounds, the program displays each player's total score and announces the winner based on the highest score.
